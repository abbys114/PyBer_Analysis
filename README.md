# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to seperte the ride sharing data by type.  The three different types include Urban, Suburban, and Rural.  Dividing the data into these categories help us to better understand the data, which we can use to focus our efforts with ride sharing to maximize profits for Pyber.  This data that we analyzed can be seen through charts and graphs to better visulize our findings.

## Results
