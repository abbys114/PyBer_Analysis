# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to seperte the ride sharing data by type.  The three different types include Urban, Suburban, and Rural.  Dividing the data into these categories help us to better understand the data, which we can use to focus our efforts with ride sharing to maximize profits for Pyber.  This data that we analyzed can be seen through charts and graphs to better visualize our findings.

## Results
Our analysis concludes that the data differs between the different city types.  As seen in the chart and graph below, the total fares for the different city types is highest in the Urban areas with $39,854.38, compared to Suburban with $19,356.33 and Rural with $4,327.93.  Urban areas also had the most rides total and most drivers.  These results make sense, as Urban areas usually have higher populations and destinations are usually closer together.  When comparing average fare per ride and average fare per driver, Rural areas had the highest value.  This supports the idea that Rural areas tend to be less populated and more spread out, making for a longer driving time.  Overall, this data helps us better analyze the different city types and how they compare to each other.

## Summary
Based on the results of our analysis, here are some recomendations for the company to improve their services to increase profits.  For Urban areas, Pyber should try using the ride share drivers to pick up and deliver food.  This would be appealing to people who do not want to drive to pick up their food, but are ordering from a restaurant that does not deliver.  For Suburban areas, Pyber should promote rides to and from airports in suburbs near airports, as they may be longer rides, which will increase fare size.  In Rural areas, Pyber should have a promotion for new users to get their first ride free to increase number of rides in these areas.  Allowing them to try it for free the first time will let them experience the convience of it and they will want to use it again.  Overall, these recomendations could help the company grow.
