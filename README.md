# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to seperte the ride sharing data by type.  The three different types include Urban, Suburban, and Rural.  Dividing the data into these categories help us to better understand the data, which we can use to focus our efforts with ride sharing to maximize profits for Pyber.  This data that we analyzed can be seen through charts and graphs to better visulize our findings.

## Results
Our analysis concludes that the data differs between the different city types.  As seen in the chart and graph below, the total fares for the different city types is highest in the Urban areas with $39,854.38, compared to Suburban with $19,356.33 and Rural with $4,327.93.  Urban areas also had the most rides total and most drivers.  These results make sense, as Urban areas usually have higher populations and destinations are usually closer together.  When comparing average fare per ride and average fare per driver, Rural areas had the highest value.  This supports the idea that Rural areas tend to be less populated and more spread out, making for a longer driving time.  Overall, this data helps us better analyze the different city types and how they compare to each other.
